# Redux: Getting Started
Following along with [Dan Abramov's course on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux).

I'm importing React, ReactDOM, and Redux at the versions used in the tutorial. If you look in package.json, you'll see that they're locked at these very specific versions.

## Notes
Through video #29.

## Run
To run the stuff in lessons 1 - 8, navigate into that folder and start a server, like so:

```
httpster
```

Then bring up the [App](http://localhost:3333)

To run the other stuff, build with

```
gulp
```

Then run the server:

```
gulp server
```
